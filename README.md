A simple web calculator that performs the most basic operations

## Design
I used three colors for design: #1C1C1E for the background color of the webpage, the calculator body and the buttons themselves.
#DAD7CD for the background color of the display, text color of the buttons and the footer.
#E53D00 for the color of the borders and hover effect over the buttons and the link in the footer

I mostly used Flexbox Layout to align everything on the page except for the button grid. For the buttons, I used Grid Layout.

## Capabilities
The calculator can perform the most basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo. It can also calculate decimal numbers with the help of the decimal button right at the bottom of the button grid.

If the user has made a typo or wants to clear the entire display, he can accomplish that by using two buttons at the top left corner of the button grid. The first one will clear the entire display, while the next one is going to remove the last character.

As of 14th of August, 2022 the calculator cannot divide by zero. I hope to fix this issue in the future :)
